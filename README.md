There are a total of three simulation assignmernts, six labs, and a final project. 

# NI Digilent Nexys A7-100T FPGA Trainer Board

The NI Digilent [Nexys A7](https://digilent.com/shop/nexys-a7-fpga-trainer-board-recommended-for-ece-curriculum/) is 
a rebrand of the Nexys 4 DDR board with the addition of the Nexys A7-50T variant of the Nexys A7, which has a smaller gate array. 
The Nexys A7-100T variant is functionally identical to the Nexys 4 DDR.
The Nexys A7-100T contains 15,850 [logic slices](https://www.ni.com/en-us/support/documentation/supplemental/18/slices-on-an-fpga-chip.html) 
each with 4 [look-up tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lookup_table) (LUTs) and 8 [flip-flops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flop_(electronics)).
The Nexys A7-50T that contains 8,150 logic slices was discontinued and is no longer available for purchase.

A [Xilinx Design Constraints](https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/guides/vivado-xdc-file) (XDC) file provides the physical pins on the FPGA in relation to the HDL code.
Here are master XDC files for A7-100T and A7-50T boards with identical constraints:
* [Nexys-A7-100T-Master.xdc](/Nexys-A7/Nexys-A7-100T-Master.xdc)
* [Nexys-A7-50T-Master.xdc](/Nexys-A7/Nexys-A7-50T-Master.xdc)

The master XDC files of all Digilent boards can be found [here](https://github.com/Digilent/digilent-xdc).

![install-2.png](/Nexys-A7/install-2.png)
* Download and extract [board files](https://github.com/Digilent/vivado-boards/archive/master.zip)
  * The ZIP file has a folder called new/board_files including a folder called [nexys-a7-100t](https://github.com/Digilent/vivado-boards/tree/master/new/board_files/nexys-a7-100t/D.0)
  * For the Nexys A7-50T board, use [nexys-a7-50t](https://github.com/Digilent/vivado-boards/tree/master/new/board_files/nexys-a7-50t/D.0) instead
* Make a new folder called board_files as This PC > Local Disk (C:) > Xilinx > Vivado > 2024.1 (or whatever version you are running) > data > boards > board_files 
* Copy and paste the nexys-a7-100t folder
* There should be four files in This PC > Local Disk (C:) > Xilinx > Vivado > 2024.1 (or whatever version you are running) > data > boards > board_files > nexys-a7-100t > D.0 > 1.3
  * board.xml
